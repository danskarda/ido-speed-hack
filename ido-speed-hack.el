;; =================
;;
;; Speed optimisations for Emacs IDO mode. It makes ido completion fast
;; and interactive even with large sets of completions (eg. list of all
;; commands in M-x, or large Info index files like Elisp or Emacs
;; manual).
;;
;; Optimisations
;; -------------
;; ido-speed-hack increases ido performance in several ways:
;;
;; * disabling ido-case-fold for some completions (all commands are lowercase anyway)
;; * prunning collections based on character bitmaps
;; * caching character bitmaps during completion or for same completions
;; * caching intermediate completion lists when adding new characters
;;
;; Optimisations
;; -------------
;; ido-speed-hack increases ido performance in several ways:
;;
;; * function inlining (defsubst)
;; * disabling ido-case-fold for some completions (all commands are lowercase anyway)
;; * prunning collections based on character bitmaps
;; * caching character bitmaps during completion or for same completions
;; * caching intermediate completion lists when adding new characters
;;
;; Last three optimisations works only when regular expressions are disabled.
;;
;; Character bitmaps
;; -----------------
;; List of completions are prefiltered based on character bitmaps
;; Character bitmap is computed in function ido-string-to-bitmask.
;;
;; Each character from a .. z (regardless case) is assigned one bit.
;; Numbers, special characters - and * has also one bit assigned. 30 bits
;; are enought to store all flags.
;;
;; Character bitmap of a string is or of each individual string
;; characters.
;;
;; Before ido starts to examine completion list, ido-speed-hack
;; prefilters the list and removes all words which miss some characters
;; in ido-text. The filter is based on bitmap comparision.
;;
;; Bitmap caching
;; --------------
;; All bitmaps are cached during an execution of completing-read.
;; For special commands (execute-extended-command, describe-function,
;; smex etc) this cache is shared between executions.
;;
;; Result caching
;; --------------
;; If previous completion is a prefix of current completion, speed hack
;; reuses results from previous call so ido does not start from original
;; (long) list.
;;
;; Configuration
;; -------------
;; Use variable ido-speed-hints-alist to fine-tune hints for individual commands.
